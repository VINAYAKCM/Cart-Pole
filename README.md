**CART-POLE**

This project leverages reinforcement learning within OpenAI's Gymnasium library to train an agent to balance a pole on a moving cart. The primary objective is to optimize the agent's performance by continuously learning and adapting to the dynamic balancing challenge.

**OVERVIEW**

The Cart Pole environment used in this project is based on the CartPole-v1 environment provided by OpenAI's Gymnasium. This environment is designed to challenge the reinforcement learning agent with the task of balancing a pole on a cart by applying forces to the left or right.

**ENVIRONMENT DETAILS**

The CartPole-v1 environment provides a simplified simulation of a classic control problem. The agent's objective is to keep the pole balanced by controlling the cart's movement. The environment provides:

•State Space: The state is represented by four variables: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, and pole velocity at the tip.

•Action Space: The agent can apply a force of +1 or -1 to the cart, corresponding to a push to the right or left.

•Rewards: The agent receives a reward of +1 for every timestep that the pole remains upright. The episode ends when the pole falls over or the cart moves out of the boundary.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

The implementation of this project involves training a reinforcement learning model using algorithms such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Policy Gradient methods. The model learns to interpret the state variables and output actions that keep the pole balanced.

**KEY FEATURES**

•Dynamic Balancing: The environment challenges the agent with the task of balancing a pole on a moving cart, requiring precise control and decision-making.

•Continuous Learning: The agent improves its performance through iterative learning, adapting to various balancing scenarios.

•Advanced Algorithms: Utilizes state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms to achieve optimal performance in the balancing task.
